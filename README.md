## Overview

**Fluchenmeister** is a *work-in-progress (WIP)* educational project designed to help learners understand how data theft techniques work - and, more importantly, how to **defend against them**.  

By studying simulated attack chains, users can gain insight into:
- How information can be compromised.
- How modern operating systems protect against these threats.
- How to detect, mitigate, and harden systems against them.
